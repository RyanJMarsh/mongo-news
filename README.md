## MongoNews API

Using the same sample data as my Northcoders Project I have recreated the News API using mongoDB.

I decided to build this to get a better idea of how mongoDB works and how NoSQL differs from SQL. I also wanted to make sure I knew how to set up the database from scratch, as opposed to the framework we had in place at Northcoders.
