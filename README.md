## MongoNews App

Using the same sample data as one of the Northcoders Project I created a News App using mongoDB to store the data.

I decided to build this to get a better idea of how mongoDB works and how NoSQL differs from SQL. I also wanted to make sure I knew how to set up the database from scratch, as opposed to the framework we had in place at Northcoders.

## Features

This app allows you to filter through the articles in the database. It also allows you to vote and comment on individual articles.
